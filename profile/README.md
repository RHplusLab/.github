**RHplusLab** is an open-source project initiated by **Roboin**, a student club at Yonsei University, since July 2022. The project involves building and studying robotic arms ranging from **2-axis** to **6-axis** and ultimately a **22-axis humanoid robot**.

## Main Objectives

- Develop **full-stack robotic systems**, covering everything from hardware to software integration
- Gain systematic experience with **2D movements**, **3D movements and position tracking**, and **dynamic 3D environment control**
- Bridge the gap between **academic research** and **industrial applications** by building a comprehensive open-source ecosystem for robotics

## Vision
We believe in sharing knowledge and inviting collaboration to expand the horizons of robotics. By documenting and open-sourcing our work, we invite all who are passionate about robotics—students, researchers, professionals—to join us in creating next-generation robotic solutions.
